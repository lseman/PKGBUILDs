# PKGBUILD Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing PKGBUILDs for distributions based on Pacman, primarily focused on CachyOS. This repository hosts a collection of custom, slightly modified, and Intel MKL optimized PKGBUILDs. Additionally, it includes several PKGBUILDs for Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) versions of various packages.

## Usage

To use these PKGBUILDs, clone the repository and navigate to the desired package directory. From there, you can build the package using the standard makepkg commands.
